Program Description:

This program finds the inverse of the matrix given as an input if there is any.  If the inverse does not exist, it returns the message that the inverse does not exist.
This program uses Gauss-Jordan method here to find the inverse.

Instruction:

Run inverser.py and then enter the input matrix as said in the message displayed.  The program would display the inverse matrix.
